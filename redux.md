# Redux:

- Global state management
- Three concepts: action, reducer and store
- `createStore` function accepts reducer (which holds the state) as a parameter
- `getState` function of the store return the current state
- `subscribe` function accepts another function as an argument and it is called every time on the update of the state.
- `dispatch` is other important function of redux store. It allows us to change the state. It accepts an action(or action creator).
